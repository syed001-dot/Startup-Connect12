# Startup Connect ER Diagram

This document contains the Entity-Relationship diagram for the Startup Connect application. The diagram is written in Mermaid format and can be rendered using any Mermaid-compatible viewer.

## Relationships Overview

1. **User Relationships**
   - A User can have one StartupProfile (for startup users)
   - A User can have one InvestorProfile (for investor users)
   - A User can send many Messages
   - A User can receive many Messages
   - A User can have many Notifications

2. **StartupProfile Relationships**
   - A StartupProfile belongs to one User
   - A StartupProfile can have many PitchDecks
   - A StartupProfile can have many Transactions (as recipient)
   - A StartupProfile can receive many InvestmentOffers

3. **InvestorProfile Relationships**
   - An InvestorProfile belongs to one User
   - An InvestorProfile can make many Transactions
   - An InvestorProfile can make many InvestmentOffers

## Key Features

- The system supports both Startup and Investor user types through profiles
- Investment process is tracked through Transactions and InvestmentOffers
- Communication is facilitated through Messages
- Users are notified of important events through Notifications
- Startups can manage their pitch decks
- Detailed tracking of investment negotiations and transactions

## Notes

- All timestamps are stored as DateTime
- Files (like pitch decks) are stored with metadata and content
- The system supports negotiation workflow through Transaction entity
- Investment offers can have different statuses (ACTIVE, CLOSED, EXPIRED, NEGOTIATION)
